<h1>SCIVIS: About Us!</h1>

<h2>Dan Oates</h2>
<p></p>I am currently retired from the W. Va. Schools for the Deaf and the Blind (WVSDB), in Romney, W. Va. I hold a Master’s in Education, with past AER certifications as Teacher of the Visually Impaired, an Orientation and Mobility Instructor (COMS), and a Low Vision Therapist (CLVT).</p><p>

During my time I worked as an Orientation and Mobility Instructor for 14 years and as an Outreach Specialist for 16 years. As an Outreach Specialist I coordinated a statewide program for blind and low vision infants, toddlers, preschoolers, and families.</p><p>

In 1990, I was a chaperone on the first trip of blind and visually impaired students to attend Space Camp at the request of Edward O. Buckbee, Director of the U. S. Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama. In 1994, I began coordinating the program and assisted in attracting students from other states, countries, and public schools. As of 2025, I remain as the only person to have attended Space Camp for Interested Visually Impaired Students (SCIVIS) for all of the 35 years.</p><p>

In 1993 and 1994, I chaperoned students from West Virginia to Russia for a space science exchange. I received a Fulbright Scholarship in 1998 to travel to Australia on a promotional tour for SCIVIS.</p><p>

In 1996, I began volunteering on a limited basis for Space Camp’s Education Teacher Training Program at Space Camp. In 2000, I was hired as a crew trainer for the Teacher Training Program and continued in that position each summer until I retired in 2012 from my position in W. Va. at the school for the blind. I was then promoted to Manager of the Space Camp Teacher Training Program and remained in that summer position until 2018.
</p><p>
In 2007, I was honored with an induction into the Space Camp Hall of Fame in the inaugural class with Space Camp founders Edward Buckbee and Dr. Wernher von Braun. I have worked with NASA, the Challenger Centers, Space Center Houston, and other agencies as a consultant for programs for the blind and visually impaired. I served on the board of directors for eight years with the National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation (NOAH). I am an active member of the W. Va. Schools for the Deaf and Blind Foundation, the Fort Mill Ridge Foundation, historical local landmarks commission, and the local food pantry at my church. I am also the W. Va. Schools for the Deaf and the Blind school historian and preservationist.
</p><p>
I have promoted the SCIVIS program in many of the residential schools for the blind, state, and national conferences. I have also traveled to Australia, Russia, Ireland, and St. Lucia and promoted SCIVIS so students from those countries can attend.
</p><p>
I have volunteered at the Werhner von Braun Archives at the U. S. Space & Rocket Center. My primary function is to record the institutional knowledge of the Space Camp programs, which includes our Space Camp for Interested Visually Impaired Students (SCIVIS) program. My thirty-five-year history with the Center is the primary reason I have been asked to participate in this project.
</p><p>
During the SCIVIS “off-season”, I am consumed with the history of our small town in which I am a lifelong resident. I have published two books concerning the history of the area and write a monthly history article for our local paper. I also have been caning chairs for over 45 years, which occupies much of my time.
</p><p>
 

SCIVIS continues to be a large part of my life, even 14 years after retirement. While not a science or math teacher, I have always been a science, math, and space nerd. My connection with Space Camp, 10 years after I was employed with the W. Va. Schools for the Deaf and the Blind, helped complete my “nerdiness”.
