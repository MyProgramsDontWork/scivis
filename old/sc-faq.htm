<h2><img alt="Student on the Space Station review a large print checklist." border="0" class="left" src="station.jpg" /><img align="middle" alt="" height="32" src="icons/shuttle.gif" width="32" /><a id="compare" name="compare"></a>How does the SCIVIS Week compare to a regular week at Space Camp?</h2>

<p>This special week is coordinated by teachers of the visually impaired from all over the United States. Many adaptations are available this week that are not available during a normal week at Space Camp. Braille, large print, CCTV&#39;s, voice output on selected computers, visually impaired speakers, and support help from certified teachers of the visually impaired are just a few. Siblings or friends of visually impaired students are welcome to attend the same week. Discounted tuition is also available this week as a result of the group rate.</p>

<h2><img align="middle" alt="" height="32" src="icons/shuttle.gif" width="32" /><a id="excused" name="excused"></a>Is attending SCIVIS an excused absence from school?</h2>

<p>The decision of &#39;excused absence&#39; is up to the local school. We know of no instance when a student was not excused for attending SCIVIS. We have created an <a href="SchoolAbsenceLetter.doc">attendance letter</a> that you can give to school officials if there are questions.</p>

<hr />
<h2><img align="middle" alt="" height="32" src="icons/shuttle.gif" width="32" /> <a id="how" name="how">Why should I go Space Camp</a>?</h2>

<p>Ask yourself these questions.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Do I have an interest in math, science, and space science?</li>
	<li>Do I enjoy new social and learning experiences?</li>
	<li>Do I have independent skills in the areas of daily living and social skills?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you answer YES! to these questions, read the rest of information on this page, then go to <a href="registration.htm">SCIVIS Registration</a> to register!</p>

<h2><img alt="Students gathered around a jet simulator." class="left" height="172" src="ac2.jpg" width="226" /><img align="middle" alt="" height="32" src="icons/shuttle.gif" width="32" /> <a id="money" name="money">What about money? Are Scholarships available</a>?</h2>

<p>Programs cost for the room, programming, materials, etc. from Sunday lunch to Friday lunch. Transportation cost is not included. Money is available for partial scholarships.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Camp, Academy, MACH 1 - $1395,</li>
	<li>Academy &amp; Aviation Challenge MACH 2 - $1467</li>
	<li>Advanced Academy &amp; MACH 3&nbsp;- $1539</li>
</ul>

<p>Scholarships are available for our program only. Please go to <a href="scforms.htm">SCIVIS: Scholarship Form Page</a> for the online SCIVIS Scholarship forms.</p>

<p>You will need to complete the scholarship application in its entirety and forward it along with a letter of recommendation from your math or science teacher. Please note that there are 2 essay questions that must be completed.</p>

<p>Scholarships are available pending funding from granting organizations. Total amounts of scholarships are impossible to predict. Never assume scholarships are in the full amount of tuition (usually 25%-50%).</p>

<p>Deadlines vary.&nbsp; Please see the Delta Gamma Scholarships Form for exact date.</p>

<p>We strongly encourage you to seek funding on a local level, if assistance is needed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many civic organizations are open to funding the Space Camp Experience for blind and visually impaired children. Promise your funding organization a program at their weekly meeting when you return. That will show your appreciation for their donation and may further your chances of returning for future programs. Once you are there you will want to go back.</p>

<h2><img align="middle" alt="" height="32" src="icons/shuttle.gif" width="32" /> <a id="Departures" name="Departures">What if I have to arrive early or I have to leave a day later?</a></h2>

<p>If your travel schedule requires arrival the day prior to the Sunday start of SCIVIS or to depart a day later than Friday departure day, you will be required to pay a $150 fee for late departure/early arrival. This fee includes meals, lodging and supervision. Upon arrival the student or group will be assigned an early arrival team, who will be an employee of the U. S. Space and Rocket Center.&nbsp;Chaperones arriving early or departing late with students should remain with their team and be responsible for them.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Graduation is planned for Thursday of SCIVIS week at approximately 7 PM</li>
	<li>Early Arrival should be scheduled no earlier than 11 a.m. on Saturday, prior to the start of SCIVIS.</li>

Is there a cost?</a></h2>

<p>The total round trip cost for transportation the airport to Space Camp and back is $75.00/student. Space Camp staff will be waiting at the airport. They will make sure bags are picked up. The Space Camp staff will also place the campers on the Space Camp bus to be transported to Habitat 1. The bus will also take the campers back to the airport and staff will ensure they get on the plane home. Chaperones attending Space Camp with groups of children will not be billed for this cost.</p>

<hr />
<h2><img align="middle" alt="" height="32" src="icons/shuttle.gif" width="32" /> <a id="spending" name="spending">How much personal spending money should I bring?</a></h2>

<p>Chaperones should be encouraged to keep money for the students if at all possible. Students traveling to Space Camp unaccompanied should bring a lock for their personal locker to keep money under lock and key. This is a good idea for all students. Space Camp staff members can not keep money for their team members.</p>

<p>Opportunities for attendees to spend personal money abound. There are 2 museum shops with many souvenirs including: space patches, buttons, rockets, books, models, posters, clothing, movies, etc. There are also 2 snack bars and various juice, snack, and soft drink machines. Remember that all meals are provided.</p>

<p>Flight suits and other uniform packages are available at the Space &amp; Rocket Center Gift Shops upon arrival or departure.&nbsp;Many other clothing accessories are available. See more information about <a href="https://www.spacecamp.com/about/spacecampstore">Space Camp Store</a></p>

<p>The amount of personal spending money sent with a Space Camp attendee is the decision of the parents or guardians.</p>

<p><strong>PLEASE COMPLETE THE SCI-VIS On-Line HEALTH FORM!</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Your child cannot start program activities without a completed Health Form.</li>
	<li>Any medical problems we need to be aware of must be noted.</li>
	<li><strong>Please bring A WEEKS worth of medication</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A registered nurse is on-site 24/7 for all weeklong, overnight camp programs. Our nurses are available to discuss any concerns you may have prior to camp. Nurses Station phone number: 256-721-7162</p>

<p>All prescription medications, vitamins and herbal products will be collected and administered by the nursing staff. <strong>They must be in their original container with the original label </strong>in order to be dispensed, and they are given as directed by the label on the bottle, not how attendee states he/she takes it. Any changes must be noted by the physician prescribing the medication. Our Nurses Station carries numerous over-the-counter medications so it is not necessary for attendees to bring these. <strong>Attendee</strong><strong>s are not permitted to keep any medications with them.</strong></p>

<p>U.S. SPACE CAMP and AVIATION CHALLENGE are learning environments with a structured curriculum. Attendees should continue taking any medication that affects behavior or learning ability.</p>

<p>Additional note: the Space Camp &amp; Aviation Challenge day may be longer than your child is used to, (7 AM - 10 PM) so please adjust directions on medications, if necessary.</p>

<p><strong>All emergencies go to Huntsville Hospital for Women and Children.</strong></p>

	<li>travel canes (if needed) -
	<blockquote><strong>All students using canes must bring their cane and use it while attending camp.</strong><br />
	The travel demands required of students attending Space Camp involve negotiation of a variety of environments. They must negotiate the airport, travel within the very large Space Camp campus as well as the dorm facility, and remain oriented on occasional community excursions. While campers typically travel as a group with counselors, chaperones, and other students (sighted guides) present, each camper is encouraged to be as independent as possible in these settings. Although every effort is made to provide a safe and barrier free environment, normal environmental hazards such as steps, stairs, poles, and obstacles exist in all of these locations. If your child uses a cane for any kind of travel, they will be required to travel with their cane at all times while attending Space Camp. This will ensure their safety as well as increase their independent experiences.</blockquote>

<h2><img align="middle" alt="" height="32" src="icons/shuttle.gif" width="32" /> <a id="sleep" name="sleep"></a>What are the sleeping arrangements?</h2>

<p align="left">Trainees (campers) stay in dormitories called Habitats. The Habitats are set-up to resemble futuristic space stations. The rooms are similar to college housing and can hold anywhere from 7 to 40 trainees. Placement in the habitat is determined by our availability. The beds are bunk beds, and a bottom bed may be requested for medical reasons, sleepwalking, etc. Males and females are housed separately.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Bedding packs (sheets, blankets, etc.) are available for a rental fee of $10 for the week. This will be made available upon registration.</p>

<p align="left">Crew Trainers don&rsquo;t live in the rooms with the trainees, but have their own private rooms down the hallway. A Crew Trainer is always on-call in case of an emergency.</p>

<h2><img align="middle" alt="" height="32" src="icons/shuttle.gif" width="32" /> <a id="discipline" name="discipline"></a>How does Space Camp handle disciplinary issues?</h2>

<p>Our Crew Trainers are taught to handle issues very well, and we generally have a three-strike policy. If a child misbehaves, he or she is sent to a member of management. If he or she misbehaves for a third time, a parent is called to pick up the child.</p>

<h2><img align="middle" alt="" height="32" src="icons/shuttle.gif" width="32" /> <a id="crew" name="crew"></a>Who are the Crew Trainers?</h2>

<p>Our team leaders, are known as Crew Trainers, come from all backgrounds and walks of life. While one year of college is required, many have completed their degrees. Crew Trainers are background checked during the hiring process. They must complete a lengthy training which includes instruction in curriculum, discipline and safety.</p>
