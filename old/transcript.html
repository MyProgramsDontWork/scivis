<h1>Homer
  Hickam, Jr. Transcript</h1>
<p>Brandon: Mr. Hickam (Homer)</p>
<p>Homer: Yes, Brandon. What can I do for you?</p>
<p>Brandon: I just wanted to know what you thought of the graduation ceremonies,
  and Space Camp and things like that...and...and...just basically what you thought.</p>
<p>Homer: Well, What I thought tonight...you know...they used to say about the
  Rocket Boys that we had a lot of passion for what we did, and that we had a
  lot of perseverance to accomplish all of the things we did.</p>
<p>But, after seeing the kids tonight, I don't think the Rocket Boys really knew
  the meaning of the word perseverance.</p>
<p>These kids tonight really know what it means.</p>
<p>It just pleases...It was a very touching ceremony and I really enjoyed being
  here. So, Dan thank-you very much for having me.</p>
<p>Dan: No problem. I'm glad you could come.</p>
<p>Homer: My pleasure.</p>
<p>Dan: What can I say.</p>
<p>Brandon: Thank-you very much Mr. Hickam.</p>
<p>Homer: You're quite welcome.</p>
