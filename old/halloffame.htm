  <h2> Eight to be Inducted into Space Camp Hall of Fame</h2>
    <p> HUNTSVILLE, AL -- The U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center proudly announces eight
        people, including famed rocket scientist Dr. Wernher von Braun and Dottie
        Metcalf-Lindenburger, one of America&rsquo;s youngest astronauts, will be
        inducted into the Space Camp Hall of Fame on Wednesday, June 13th. The black
        tie optional event will take place in the Von Braun Center&rsquo;s North
      Hall beginning at 7:00 p.m.</p>
    <p> Award winning actor William Shatner will emcee the event, with special
        guests former NASA astronauts Story Musgrave and Jim Halsell.</p>
    <p> Other members of the inaugural class of inductees include Edward O. Buckbee,
        Dr. Georg von Tiesenhausen, Dan Oates, Amanda Stubblefield, Dr. James
        Rice, and Penny Pettigrew.</p>
    <p> The Space Camp Hall of Fame was created to help celebrate the 25th anniversary
        of Space Camp and designed to honor graduates, former employees and supporters
        who have distinguished themselves in their respective careers or made
        considerable in-kind contributions in an effort to help further the goals
        of the Space Camp program. Current plans call for as many as ten to be
        inducted annually.</p>
    <p> Von Braun will be the first.</p>
    <p> When the names are called and the nominees introduced, Dr. Wernher von
            Braun will be the first. Best known for his leading role in the development
            of America&rsquo;s manned space flight program, von Braun also conceived the
        idea for Space Camp. In 1977, while touring the Space &amp; Rocket Center,
        he shared, with former CEO Ed Buckbee, his vision of an educational camp
        program for children designed to help prepare the next generation of
        engineers, mathematicians and scientists.</p>
    <p> Later that year, von Braun lost his battle with cancer. But the seed
        was planted that would sprout to life the world&rsquo;s first educational
        space science camp program for children. Von Braun led the way to the
        moon, and today his vision continues to lead young people to reach for
        the stars.</p>
    <p> One of those far-reaching youngsters attended Space Camp at
        the age of 14, and she would later describe the experience as life changing.
        The door was opened to a new world for Dottie Metcalf-Lindenburger; a
        world so exciting, she chose a career path that would allow her to share
        her love of science with others. One day, a student in the high school
        astronomy class she taught asked a question that sent her to the NASA
        web site in search of an answer.</p>
    <p> What she found was also life changing. NASA had just posted a call for
        teachers willing to enter the astronaut corps, and Dottie applied. She
        became the youngest member of the Educator Astronaut Candidate Class
        of 2004. Today, Dottie has completed her astronaut training and is awaiting
        flight assignment. She becomes the first Space Camp graduate inducted
        into the Hall of Fame.</p>
    <p> No program could flourish as Space Camp has over the years without friends
        who believe in and support your efforts. Friends like Dr. Georg von Tiesenhausen,
        an American by choice who followed Dr. von Braun from Peenem&uuml;nde
        to Huntsville, and has spent the last 20 years of his retirement visiting
        Space Camp weekly to share his vast experience&hellip; And Dan Oates
        who, for the last 15 years, has surrendered his summers and much of his
        free time to bring to life a special Space Camp program for children
        who are blind. Under the category of Friend of Space Camp, both Oates
        and Dr. von Tiesenhausen become the first inductees.</p>
    <p> Former Space Camp staff members to be inducted include Amanda Stubblefield
        and Dr. James Rice, both former camp counselors. Amanda went from training
        students at Space Camp to training astronauts at NASA&rsquo;s Johnson
        Space Flight Center. And Dr. Rice went to Mars! Well actually, he went
        to Arizona State University and to the Mars Rover Project. He&rsquo;s
        a critical member of the team that sent the rovers Spirit and Opportunity
        to explore the surface of the red planet.</p>
    <p> Our next inductee is another Space Camp grad with her feet planted firmly
        in the stars. Penny J. Pettigrew now works at NASA&rsquo;s Marshall Space
        Flight Center in the Ares I program, that will soon replace the shuttle
        and provide the vehicle that will help return humans to the moon and
        beyond.</p>
    <p> Finally, the man who was here from day one&hellip; Who took von Braun&rsquo;s
        vision and molded it into reality&hellip; the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket
        Center&rsquo;s very first CEO, Ed Buckbee. When Ed came on-board, the
        Space &amp; Rocket Center was only a good idea. Under his leadership,
        it became the biggest space science museum on the planet. It would be
        seven years after it opened before Buckbee&rsquo;s close friend, in one
        of their final conversations, shared his dream of a summer camp program
        for children that would introduce them to the science of space flight.</p>
    <p> Von Braun&rsquo;s vision became Buckbee&rsquo;s mission and five years
        later, the first group of children came to Huntsville to share in a unique
        experience. They would train as an astronaut, fly simulated missions
        in space, build and launch their own model rockets. They would be the
        first of a half-million. They, and Buckbee, launched Space Camp.</p>
    <p> Buckbee guided the program through those first critical years and a quarter-century
        later, they&rsquo;re still coming. In fact next month, during its 25th
        consecutive season, Space Camp will honor its 500,000th graduate!</p>
    <p> The induction banquet will begin with a formal dinner, during which a
        50-minute series of videos and news clips will be played over a pair
        of giant screen television monitors. These are stories and films once
        featured on local and national television programs and newscasts, many
        unseen in the last 25-30 years.</p>
    <p> Following dinner, the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center will unveil a new
        postal cache. The U.S. Postal Service will operate a temporary station
        at the Space &amp; Rocket Center</p>
