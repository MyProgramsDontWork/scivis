<h1>Why Attend Space Camp?</h1>
<p>?1998 KATE went to SCIVIS, Space Camp for the vision impaired, as a 14  year old in 1998. On her return she wrote </p><p>
  &ldquo;.it was more than a once in a lifetime experience, it was the time  of our lives. It helped us not only  realise that if we try hard and aim for the sky we can reach the stars, but we  also met friends that would last a lifetime. We lived each day as if it were  our last and can recall every minute spent with our friends. The hardest and  saddest time over there was saying goodbye. Our hearts were broken and as left  a part of us stayed forever. We learnt knowledge that we can use in our  curriculum, met others with similar problems, and ways to deal with it. </p>

  2012 KATE&rsquo;S STORY</h2>
<h3>
  <strong>Just Call Me Lucky &nbsp;</strong> </h3>
<p>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;ll lose all useful sight&rdquo; I heard the Dr say in  hushed tones to my weeping mother as I swung my little legs back and forth  under the hallway chair that was too tall for my six year old legs. It was another  ten minutes before she walked out of the Dr&rsquo;s office dabbing the corner of her  eyes, as if an eyelash had strayed and irrated them. But I knew her too well. I  knew that she would hold herself together, push back the feelings of guilt and  despair until we got home and I was safely tucked into bed. And then she would  curl herself into a ball and cry and cry. She will cry because she thinks she  has done this to me. She will cry because I will never be like other children.  She will cry because I will never be like other children. She will cry because  she never envisioned what her life, or hers would be like. Most of all, she  will cry because the Dr told her that I will be blind before I reach my  thirteenth birthday and what kind of life can you have if you are living in the  dark?</p><p>
  That was 10 years ago. I am happy to report the Dr was wrong. Mind  you there was no misunderstanding. I have less than five per cent of useful  vision remaining and have had a cataract removed from one eye rendering it  virtually useless. I am completely night blind and have glaucoma. Despite the  degenerating genetic draw I was handed in life I feel the luckiest girl in the  world. Let me tell you why.</p><p>
  When I was in secondary school I was assigned a visiting teacher.  She was incredible, a whirlwind of energy, determination and hope. A rock solid  pillar who would remain a positive force throughout my life. In 1998 she  introduced me to a man called Dan. He was visiting from the USA and told us  about SCIVIS. Where, for a single week per year, the camp was run for students  who were blind I was intrigued by his stories of courage from the vision  impaired children he had worked with back home. Space camp sounded like fun  and, as any secondary student will tell you, there comes a time when you need  to break free and really, just have some fun. After being the &lsquo;only&rsquo; different  person at an all girls school, this sounded perfect. And so, after many a  fundraising sausage had been burnt, we were on our way.&nbsp;</p><p>
  Arriving at Space Camp for the first time will remain a treasured  memory. Everybody slept in a wing of the giant building called the Hab. There  were three floors connected by metal stairs and corridors. And there wasn&rsquo;t  another soul in sight except Dan who greeted us with a warm smile and hug. We were  first to arrive and by dinner time the noisy steel corridors were bustling with  scores of new arrivals. If you looked around you would have seen even less  vision and it gave new meaning to the phrase, the blind leading the blind&rsquo;</p><p>
  While walking to my room I tripped and fell over nothing as I  sometimes did. Embarrassed I looked around and to my astonishment nobody was  gawking, laughing, pointing or staring. Nobody. Was I invisible? Had I acquired  super powers? No Finally it dawned on me. It&rsquo;s OK here, I&rsquo;m Okay. No I&rsquo;m better  than Okay, I&rsquo;m normal! Could this be the best day of my entire life? I think  so. And just as I was coming to terms with how wonderfully normal I was, two  girls walked past me, one with her T shirt on backwards and the other with one brown  sock and one blue. There is nothing for it but to laugh out loud. I laughed so  hard that I doubled over, my stomach in stitches. Not until that very moment  did I know what it was like to free of anxiety, to be free of terrifying and  debilitating fear. That was one of the greatest weeks of my life. It was so  good that I proceeded to go back to Space Camp the following year and two years  after that, each time being awarded the &lsquo;Right Stuff Award&rdquo; which was the  strawberry on top of the icing on the cake because truly, I was lucky to be  there.</p><p>
  I was even luckier when my muse of a visiting teacher introduced me  to a vision impaired boy who lived close to us. He was on two of those Space  Camp trips. He became my best friend. Then, he had a party. That night I met  Chris. We formed an amazing friendship, one where I could be the girl I had  been at space camp. Free and happy. We were engaged by the time I was seventeen  and were married on the beach during our first year of university together. In  2010 our beautiful identical twin daughters were born and I haven&rsquo;t been able  to wipe the smile off my face.&nbsp;</p><p>
  Please don&rsquo;t get me wrong, life is hard and deep down I am still  utterly terrified that one day I will be living in the dark. But as nana&rsquo;s  always said, &lsquo;what is there for it but to put your bum up, head down and run at  life with all you have because one day it will be gone.&rsquo; Nan  may be right. All I know is that, as of right this moment I wouldn&rsquo;t swap my  life for anything, genes and all. After all without this lot in life I wouldn&rsquo;t  be the happiest girl in the world. Just call me Lucky.</p>

  <strong>7 Reasons to go to Space Camp</strong> </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Independence -</strong> Travelling on planes,  through airports, on buses and around the camp you quickly learn to trust your  instincts, to ask for help if needed be, to be organised and punctual. You  learn new independent living skills as you go.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Normalcy&nbsp; - </strong>For me, it was the  first time I felt normal, the same as everybody else<strong>. </strong>Every person has  an impairment and your impairment seems to fade in the background along with  everybody else&rsquo;s, allowing your full personality to shine through.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Friendship - </strong>After more than ten years I  am still in contact with some of the friends I made at Camp. Never  underestimate the bonds you can make when you spend an intensive week, 24 hours  a day with amazing people from all over the world.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Camaraderie - </strong>You are part of a team and  on missions it is vital that each member of the group fulfil their task in  order fro the mission to be successful. And nothing is better than the cheers  that erupt after a three hour mission is completed.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Courage </strong> It takes a lot of courage to  take the plunge into unknown territory, especially if you have some physical  limitations that should not stop you. At one time or another I&rsquo;m sure every  person who leaves their families and heads to a camp half way around the world  has reservations, moments where they are scared and wonder if they can go  through with it. But overcoming the fear and plunge is what makes space camp so  unbelievable amazing. Never did I think I would go out at night without my  family or have two totally blind people holding onto my elbows even though I  could hardly see where I was going. You can do extraordinary things, Space camp  helps you along.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Achievement </strong> having my name called out  and walking onto the podium to collect my certificate that tells the world I  have achieved something is one of the proudest moments I have ever had. Knowing  that after the quizzes, training, making and launching rockets, group games,  physical challenges and one final three hour mission you can be sure you have  achieved something remarkable. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>And most of all Space Camp is fun (oh and did I mention the Imax  theatre, the life size shuttles and the food, amazing!!!!)</strong></li>
