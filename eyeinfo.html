                        <h3>General Eye Info:</h3>
                        <p>In April of 1999, Terry Schwartz, Director of Pediatric Ophthalmology at West Virginia University Eye Center, participated in an evaluation of all Space Camp training simulators. At that time recommendations were made in regard to those simulators and the SCIVIS program.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>It is the belief of the organizers of SCIVIS and Space Camp that all students should participate in the complete "Space Camp Experience", yet at the same time, safety is our utmost concern.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>All students participating in SCIVIS will be evaluated by the nurse and treated with the same medical scrutiny as a sighted camper. There is much concern for those campers who have head control and muscular-skeletal problems, shunts, cerebral palsy, etc. There may be restrictions placed on those campers by the Space Camp medical staff or by their family doctor. Space Camp medical staff has the final decision on all matters.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>As a result of this study, the eye form no longer needs to be signed by an ophthalmologist. The Eye/Health Form along with the Student Information Form should still be filled out and the eye condition, acuity, and learning media listed. This is still very important to the SCIVIS organizers. We accumulate this information and give it to the Space Camp counselors so that they may know your child better.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>Any questions regarding specific ophthalmological concerns involving participation of your child or student in the Space Camp program should be directed to Terry Schwartz, M.D. at <a href="mailto:schwartzt@wvuh.com" class="pLink">schwartzt@wvuh.com</a></p>

                        <h3>Other Considerations Eye Conditions:</h3>
                        <h4>Retinal detachment</h4>
                        <p>The question of risk as been raised specifically for children with a history of retinal detachment repair. Following successful retinal reattachment, the retina is stable or more stable than prior to surgical repair. It is unlikely that any of the above simulators pose a significant risk of retinal detachment. One exception is children with intraocular silicone oil or intraocular gas. In these children, positioning is essential for successful retinal reattachment. These children should not be inverted and in many cases should not lie on their backs. It is unlikely that these children would be participating in space camp activities since this would likely occur in the immediate post-operative period.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p class="footnote"> *Although several eye conditions predispose retinal detachment, the simulators discussed above should not significantly increase the risk of detachment. A greater risk is associated with extracurricular activities (i.e. contact sports).</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Glaucoma</h4>
                        <p>Risks for children with glaucoma include prolonged inversion and persistent vomiting. Both of these conditions increase intraocular pressure. This should only be a problem in children with end stage glaucoma.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Eye Trauma</h4>
                        <p>The risk of vision loss from eye trauma is of common concern in visually impaired. Protective eye wear would be appropriate for those children who have eye surgery (i.e. glasses with plastic safety lenses). To decrease the risk of trauma it would be helpful to provide counselors with a brief description of each child's visual dysfunction. The significance of general classes of visual impairment could be included in counselor training sessions. Examples include children with retinitis pigmentosa who function quite well under bright illumination but who rapidly become visually impaired with decreased environmental lighting. In these children, limited peripheral vision may preclude them from seeing common objects at floor level (i.e. trash cans). Children with extreme light sensitivity (i.e, achromotopsia) function quite well with decreased room illumination. However, in bright sunlight vision impairment increases dramatically and therefore mobility becomes more difficult, particularly in unfamiliar environments.</p>

                        <h3>Proposed Simulators to be Used:</h3>
                        <h4>1/6 Microgravity Chair</h4>
                        <p>This chair is designed to simulate the moons gravitational pool. The chair can move both vertically and horizontally. Vertical height is controlled by a counselor. Protective gear includes helmet and seatbelt.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>The movement of this chair is extremely gentle. This presents no greater risk for a visually impaired child, regardless of the cause of visual impairment, than it would for a sighted child.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h4>5 Degrees of Freedom Chair</h4>
                        <p>This chair is designed to simulate movement in a frictionless environment. Movement in 5 different directions is possible, including: forward/backward, side-to-side, roll, pitch and yaw. Protective gear includes helmet and safety straps. Excursion of the chair is in great part controlled by the counselor .</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>Movement this chair is gentle with no rapid acceleration or deceleration. This simulator incurs no greater risk for a visually impaired child than for a sighted child.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Manned Maneuvering Unit-1 G Trainer (MMU)</h4>
                        <p>This unit simulates a manned maneuvering unit operating in the micro-gravity of space. Similar to the 5 Degrees of Freedom Chair, motions include forward/backward, side-to-side, roll, pitch and yaw. Although inversion was previously an option, it is no longer allowed. Protective gear include helmet and safety straps.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>Use of this simulator involves slow positional changes with no inversion or rapid acceleration changes. Movement in large part is controlled by a counselor. This simulator incurs no greater risk for a visually impaired child than for a sighted child.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Multi-Axis Trainer (MAT)</h4>
                        <p>This unit simulates a tumble spin experience during reentry into the earth's atmosphere. The MAT does not spin more than twice in the same direction, but does produce inversion. There are rapid accelerations and decelerations. Theoretically there is no shifting of the inner ear fluid and therefore no vertigo with resultant nausea or vomiting is produced. Protective gear includes hand and foot restraints as well as a 5-point harness.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>This trainer produces rapid but mild changes in direction. Dizziness and nausea may result despite an intact vestibular or inner ear system. There is minimal head restraint and therefore precaution must be exercised in children with poor head control. Otherwise, there is no increased risk for the visually impaired child than for a sighted. Theoretically, vestibular disturbance is inhibited by an intact visual system. Nausea and disorientation may persist in children with extremely limited vision.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Space Shot</h4>
                        <p>This unit simulates the rapid acceleration of a rocket escaping earth's gravity. There is rapid acceleration and a slow deceleration. Safety precautions include a seat belt and a protective padded bar which fits over the shoulders. At the top of the ride as acceleration ends, campers experience a hard jolt as falling down into a padded seat.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>This unit poses no greater safety risk for visually impaired children then it does for sighted children. The rapid acceleration and the jolt against the seat bottom may be more problematic in children with muscular-skeletal disease, in particular, poor muscle tone and head control.</p>
                        <br>
